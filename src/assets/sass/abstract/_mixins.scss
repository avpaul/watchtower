/**
 This is used to generate a media query according to the type of device. It shall wrap the content
 with this media query.
 
 @param $breakpoint type of device

 When making use of this mixin, ensure the breakpoints are in descending order
 of the screen size, from biggest to smallest. This is because this mixin makes use of the max-width
 media query, so the first media query satisfied will have its properties take highest priority.

 Please note, its not required to make use of all breakpoints when making a component responsive

 Eg.
 @include respond(desk-small){

 }

 @include respond(phone){
   
 }

@mixin respond($breakpoint) {
  @if $breakpoint==mini {
    //320px - All mini screen devices between 3-4 inch
    @media (max-width: 320px) {
      @content;
    }
  }

  @if $breakpoint==phone {
    //600px -  All normal sized mobile devices
    @media (max-width: 600px) {
      @content;
    }
  }

  @if $breakpoint==tab-port {
    //900px - All tablet-sized screen in portrait mode
    @media (max-width: 900px) {
      @content;
    }
  }

  @if $breakpoint==tab-land {
    //1200px - All tablet-sized screen in landscape mode
    @media (max-width: 1200px) {
      @content;
    }
  }

  @if $breakpoint==desk-small {
    //1500px - Includes normal-sized laptop screens and small-sized desktop monitors
    @media (max-width: 1500px) {
      @content;
    }
  }

  // (> 1500px) - All large screens such as desktop monitors. These will take the default CSS properties defined
  // without using media queries.
